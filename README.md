# A-Cute-Cryptography-Learning-Note
Cryptography is an indispensable tool used to achieve interesting secure purposes in computer systems. Modern cryptography evolves and develops to achieve more functionalities from initially confidentiality and integrity to identity, authentication, anonymity and secure computation, etc. with higher security and efficiency. These new properties endow cryptography with the potential to create great value in academics and industry.   
The note is initially integrated from my notes of CS3230 (Computer Security, A+) by Reza Shokri and CS4236(Cryptography Theory and Practice, A) by Hugh Anderson. The two modules help me construct the skeleton of this note, and thereafter I extended the contends based on Cryptography I on Coursera by Dan Boneh and some academic papers. Because the note was initially my learning note, I still do not include citations and references to some works that the note is based on. Those will be coming soon and the book will keep updating as I explore more on cryptography. Please contact me if there are any typos or mistakes in the proof and explanations. Moreover, welcome to contact me to be an editor of the learning notes together, which will be a means for us to progress.
